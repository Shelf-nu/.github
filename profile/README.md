Shelf üè∑Ô∏è Asset Management infrastructure for absolutely everyone (open source).<br/> <br/>
Shelf is a simple and visual asset management and location tracking software that allows teams to categorize, manage and track their physical assets with ease.
</p>

## Core Features and Benefits üí´

With Shelf, you can take a picture of any item you own and store it in your own database. From there, you can generate a printable code (QR) that you can tag onto the item, making it easy to identify and locate in the future. Add detailed information about the item, including its purchase date, purchase price, warranty information, and more. We have no strong opinions on what an asset is - you define your own custom field logic and define rules for assets entering your database.

### Once your assets are online, you will be able to:

- Generate QR asset labels for your equipment
- Check the last known location of your assets
- Instant Search through your assets database
- Check what assets are in the custody of team members

- What gear does X have currently?
- Which assets did we appoint to our team member abroad?
- What do we have in our storage facility now?
